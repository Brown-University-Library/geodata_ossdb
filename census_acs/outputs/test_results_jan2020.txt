The following tests were performed to verify accuracy of new NYC Geodatabase scripts. API data tested against NYC Geodatabase Jan 2019 edition using compare_tables.py from DB Utils scripts. Tables also visually inspected.

# ACS 2017 vs 2017

## Test 1

api: ACS 2017 pumas
nycgdb: ACS 2017 pumas
table: acs1
vars: hshd01_e, lang03_pm, emp01_e, inc13_pm
result: matched, both tables have 251 columns and 55 rows, no discrepancy between variables

## Test 2

api: ACS 2017 pumas
nycgdb: ACS 2017 pumas
table: acs2
vars: hoc01_e, rent10_pm, sxag01_e, vote01_pm
result: matched, both tables have 239 columns and 55 rows, no discrepancy between variables

## Test 3

api: ACS 2017 tracts
nycgdb: ACS 2017 tracts
table: acs1
vars: hshd01_e, lang03_pm, emp01_e, inc13_pm
result: matched, both tables have 251 columns and 2,167 rows, no discrepancy between variables

## Test 4

api: ACS 2017 pumas
nycgdb: ACS 2017 pumas
table: acs2
vars: hoc01_e, rent10_pm, sxag01_e, vote01_pm
result: matched, both tables have 239 columns and 2,167 rows, no discrepancy between variables

## Test 5

api: ACS 2017 zctas
nycgdb: ACS 2017 zctas
table: acs1
vars: hshd01_e, lang03_pm, emp01_e, inc13_pm
result: matched, both tables have 251 columns and 215 rows, no discrepancy between variables

## Test 6

api: ACS 2017 pumas
nycgdb: ACS 2017 pumas
table: acs2
vars: hoc01_e, rent10_pm, sxag01_e, vote01_pm
result: matched, both tables have  columns and  rows, no discrepancy between variables

# ACS 2018 vs 2017

## Test 1

api: ACS 2018 DP02 - DP03 variables and labels
nycgdb: ACS 2017 acs1 table
result: There were 80 variable labels that did not match, and thus required manual update in the acs_variables spreadsheet. The majority were due to differences in punctuation (for example - DP02_0053E Nursery school, preschool in 2018 vs Nursery school preschool in 2017) or change ftom 2017 dollars values to 2018 dollar values. Two exceptions were DP02_0066 and 0067, db variables EDU09 and EDU10. In the past the census reported just the percentage and pct MOE of the population 25 and over who had a high school or bachelor's degree respectively, and the estimate and est MOEs were left blank. In 2018, they started providing the actual estimate for both, in conjunction with the pct. As such, the name of the label has changed to denote that this variable isn't just for the percentage. Data types for the estimate and est MOE columns also changed from float to integer. 

## Test 2

api: ACS 2018 DP04 - DP05 variables and labels
nycgdb: ACS 2017 acs2 table
result: There were 24 variable labels that did not match, and thus required manual update in the acs_variables spreadsheet. All of these were due to differences in punctuation, i.e. the insertion of commas.

## Test 3

api: ACS 2018 pumas
nycgdb: ACS 2017 pumas
table: acs1
vars: hshd01_e, emp08_e (households and civilian labor force)
result: matched, both tables have 251 columns and 55 rows, no unreasonable differences between values in different years

## Test 4

api: ACS 2018 pumas
nycgdb: ACS 2017 pumas
table: acs2
vars: hoc01_e, sxag01_e (housing units and total population)
result: matched, both tables have 239 columns and 55 rows, no unreasonable differences between values in different years

## Test 5

api: ACS 2018 tracts
nycgdb: ACS 2017 tracts
table: acs1
vars: hshd01_e, emp08_e (households and civilian labor force)
result: matched, both tables have 251 columns and 2,167 rows, no unreasonable differences between values in different years

## Test 6

api: ACS 2018 tracts
nycgdb: ACS 2017 tracts
table: acs2
vars: hoc01_e, sxag01_e (housing units and total population)
result: matched, both tables have 239 columns and 2,167 rows, no unreasonable differences between values in different years

## Test 7

api: ACS 2018 zctas
nycgdb: ACS 2017 zctas
table: acs1
vars: hshd01_e, emp08_e (households and civilian labor force)
result: matched, both tables have 251 columns and 215 rows, no unreasonable differences between values in different years

## Test 8

api: ACS 2018 zctas
nycgdb: ACS 2017 zctas
table: acs2
vars: hoc01_e, sxag01_e (housing units and total population)
result: matched, both tables have 239 columns and 215 rows, no unreasonable differences between values in different years

# TITLE
dct_title_s: Narragansett Reservation, Rhode Island, 2021

# DESCRIPTION
dct_description_sm:
- This is a polygon layer of the Narragansett Reservation, which is located in Charlestown, Rhode Island and is governed by the federally recognized Narragansett Indian Tribe. The Narragansett Tribe are descendants of one of the indigenous peoples of the State of Rhode Island. This layer was created from the Census TIGER/Line shapefiles, published in 2021 and delineated for the 2020 census. The reservation was selected from the American Indian / Alaska Native / Native Hawaiian Area (AIANNHA) TIGER file for the US and exported to create this new layer, which consists of one feature. The geoid column is the unique identifier created by the Census Bureau. The Brown University Library incorporated this layer into the Ocean State Spatial Database (OSSDB) project, a resource designed for basic geographic analysis and thematic mapping within the State of Rhode Island.

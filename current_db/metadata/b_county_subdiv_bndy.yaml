# TITLE
dct_title_s: County Subdivision Boundaries, Rhode Island, 2021

# DESCRIPTION
dct_description_sm:
- This is a polygon layer of county subdivision boundaries that represents their actual legal boundaries, encompassing both land and water. In Rhode Island, county subdivisions are municipal civil divisions that consist of cities and towns, and they perform all administrative and government functions below the state level (as Rhode Island has no county governments). This layer was extracted from the Census TIGER/Line shapefiles, published in 2021 and delineated for the 2020 census. The layer is intended for displaying the boundaries as a reference layer. The unique identifier is geoid, which contains the census ANSI / FIPS codes. The Brown University Library incorporated this layer into the Ocean State Spatial Database (OSSDB) project, a resource designed for basic geographic analysis and thematic mapping within the State of Rhode Island.

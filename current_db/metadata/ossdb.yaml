# TITLE
dct_title_s: Ocean State Spatial Database, Rhode Island, 2025

# DESCRIPTION
dct_description_sm:
- The Ocean State Spatial Database (OSSDB) is a geodatabase created by the Brown University Library for conducting basic geographic analysis and thematic mapping within the State of Rhode Island. It is intended to serve as a basic foundation for contemporary mapping projects, and as an educational tool for supporting GIS coursework and introducing spatial databases and SQL. It contains geographic features and data compiled from several public sources. A subset of the Census Bureau's TIGER/LINE water features were used to create a base map of coastal water, which was used to clip and create land-based areas for census geographies including counties, county subdivisions, census tracts, and ZCTAs. Census data from the 2020 Census, American Community Survey (ACS), and ZIP Code Business Patterns (ZBP) are stored in tables that can be easily related to geographic features. Point data for public facilities like schools and libraries were gathered from several state and federal agencies and transformed into spatial data that can be used for reference mapping, or analysis for measuring distance, drawing buffers, or counting features within areas. Objects in the database are labelled with a prefix that groups them into categories - 'a' objects are land-area features to be used for thematic mapping, 'b' objects are boundaries for reference mapping, 'c' objects are census data tables that can be joined to 'a' features, and 'd' objects consist of other point, line, and polygon features.  The data is appropriate for thematic mapping at a state, county, and town-level, and reference mapping at a state and county level. While it can be used for creating reference maps at the town level, it is not ideal for this purpose given the degree of generalization in the TIGER/LINE files. All of the features were transformed to share a common coordinate reference system, Rhode Island State Plane (ft-US), EPSG 3438.

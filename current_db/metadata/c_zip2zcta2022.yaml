# TITLE
dct_title_s: ZIP Code to ZCTA Relational Table, Rhode Island, 2022

# DESCRIPTION
dct_description_sm:
- This is a relational table or cross walk that links USPS ZIP Codes to the US Census Bureau's ZIP Code Tabulation Areas in Rhode Island. ZIP Codes are US postal codes that are assigned to addresses along street segments. ZCTAs are statistical areas designed by the US Census Bureau to approximate delivery areas for USPS ZIP Codes; census blocks are aggregated into ZCTAs based on the ZIP Code used by the majority of addresses in each block. Most point-based ZIP Codes that are assigned to one large business or to clusters of post office boxes are not translated into ZCTAs. The ZIP Code to ZCTA relational table from the US Health Resources and Services Administration's UDS Mapper application allows you to assign point-based ZIP Codes to the areal ZCTA that contains them, so that data is not lost from ZIP Code-based datasets when working at the ZCTA level. The ZIP Code is the unique identifier for the table, and multiple ZIP Codes can be associated with one ZCTA. A Python script was written to extract the Rhode Island records from the source table, and was used to aggregate data from the Census ZIP Code Business Patterns dataset to the ZCTA level. This table was created by the Brown University Library as part of the Ocean State Spatial Database (OSSDB) project, a resource designed for basic geographic analysis and thematic mapping within the State of Rhode Island.

# TITLE
dct_title_s: Colleges and Universities, Rhode Island, 2025

# DESCRIPTION
dct_description_sm:
- This is a point layer of post-secondary schools of higher education in Rhode Island. It was created by geocoding addresses from the Rhode Island Department of Education's School Directory against the Rhode Island Department of Transportation's E911 Sites Address Locator. The school directory report for Colleges and Universities is the basis for the dataset. Records for administrative offices, schools outside the state, and duplicates of facility records for individual school officials were expunged, and columns with names of officials and contact information were removed. The coordinates for each school are in the Rhode Island State Plane Zone in feet, and represent the center of the first parcel that was returned for the geocoded school address. Since most campuses contain several buildings over a wide area, this point represents the center of one campus building that was associated with the address. Addresses that could not initially be matched were modified to achieve matches; the add_orig column contains the original RIDE address for non-matching records. There are two unique identifiers that were generated by the RI Dept of Education, org_ID and code. There are also fields that indicate the type of school (subtype ID and name). A Python script was written to automate data processing and geocoding. This layer was created by the Brown University Library as part of the Ocean State Spatial Database (OSSDB) project, a resource designed for basic geographic analysis and thematic mapping within the State of Rhode Island, and to provide updated layers for the Rhode Island Geographic Information System (RIGIS) data repository.

# TITLE
dct_title_s: Hospitals, Rhode Island, 2023

# DESCRIPTION
dct_description_sm:
- This is a point layer of hospitals in Rhode Island. It was created by geocoding addresses from the Rhode Island Department of Health's Licensee Lists against the Rhode Island Department of Transportation's E911 Sites Address Locator. All facilities coded with the license type Hospital or Rehab Hospital Center were included. A record for the VA Hospital was added manually from the VA's directory, as this is a federal hospital not included in the state's license list. Columns with names of officials and contact information were removed. The coordinates for each hospital are in the Rhode Island State Plane Zone in feet, and represent the center of the first parcel that was returned for the geocoded hospital address. Since many hospital complexes contain several buildings over a wide area, this point represents the center of the first building that was associated with the address. Addresses that could not initially be matched were modified to achieve matches; the add_orig column contains the original licensed address for non-matching records. The unique identifier for the features is license_id, and there is an attribute column for the number of hospital beds. A Python script was written to automate data processing and geocoding. This layer was created by the Brown University Library as part of the Ocean State Spatial Database (OSSDB) project, a resource designed for basic geographic analysis and thematic mapping within the State of Rhode Island, and to provide updated layers for the Rhode Island Geographic Information System (RIGIS) data repository.

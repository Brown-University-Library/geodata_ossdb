# TITLE
dct_title_s: Population and Housing ACS Data for ZCTAs, Rhode Island, 2022

# DESCRIPTION
dct_description_sm:
- This is a census data table of population and housing statistics for ZIP Code Tabulation Areas in Rhode Island. ZCTAs are statistical areas designed by the US Census Bureau to approximate delivery areas for USPS ZIP Codes. The data in this table was drawn from the American Community Survey's 5-year estimate series, Data Profile tables P04 and P05. The estimates are published at a 90% confidence level, with four columns for each variable that are labelled with a suffix - the estimate (e), a margin of error for the estimate (m), a percent total (pe), and a margin of error for the percent total (pm). The estimate represents the midpoint of a possible range of values, while the margin of error indicates the range above and below (+/-) the midpoint. The variables were renamed to assign them to thematic groups, and variable IDs are correlated with labels in a separate acs_lookup table. The variables were chosen to represent a broad cross section of data points that would be of interest for basic thematic mapping and analysis. There are two unique identifiers, a short GEOID with ANSI / FIPS codes, and a long GEOID that includes summary level and geographic component codes plus ANSI FIPS codes. The records can be joined to spatial features using these codes. A Python script was written to extract the data from the Census Bureau's API and process it for inclusion in the database. This table was created by the Brown University Library as part of the Ocean State Spatial Database (OSSDB) project, a resource designed for basic geographic analysis and thematic mapping within the State of Rhode Island.

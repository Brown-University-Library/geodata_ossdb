dct_title_s: Public Libraries, Rhode Island, 2021

# DESCRIPTION
dct_description_sm:
- This is a point layer of all public libraries in Rhode Island. It was created by geocoding addresses from the Institute of Museum and Library Services' Public Library Survey against the Rhode Island Department of Transportation's E911 Sites Address Locator. The Public Library Outlet Data File was used to obtain the location of every central and branch library. Records for libraries outside the state, and libraries coded as book mobiles or books-by-mail services were expunged, and columns with contact information and various geographic identifiers were removed. The original PLS records contained longitude and latitude coordinates that were generated through street address interpolation, but these were expunged and addresses were rematched against RIDOTs geocoder to obtain parcel matches. The new coordinates for each library are in the Rhode Island State Plane Zone in feet, and represent the center of the first parcel that was returned for the geocoded address. Addresses that could not initially be matched were modified to achieve matches; the add_orig column contains the original PLS address for non-matching records. The libid column is the unique identifier for libraries within the state. The IMLS fscs_key column uniquely identifies each library system, while fscs_seq is unique to each branch within a system. There are fields that indicate building square footage and hours. A Python script was written to automate data processing and geocoding. This layer was created by the Brown University Library as part of the Ocean State Spatial Database (OSSDB) project, a resource designed for basic geographic analysis and thematic mapping within the State of Rhode Island, and to provide updated layers for the Rhode Island Geographic Information System (RIGIS) data repository.

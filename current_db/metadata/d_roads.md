# DESCRIPTION
dct_description_sm:
- This is a line layer of all roads in Rhode Island. This layer was extracted from the 2021 Census Tiger/Line shapefiles by merging the shapefiles for all roads in each Rhode Island county. The layer is intended for basic reference mapping. The unique identifier is linearid, created by the Census Bureau. The Brown University Library incorporated this layer into the Ocean State Spatial Database (OSSDB) project, a resource designed for basic geographic analysis and thematic mapping within the State of Rhode Island.

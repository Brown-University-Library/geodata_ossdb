# TITLE
dct_title_s: Census Tracts, Rhode Island, 2021

# DESCRIPTION
dct_description_sm:
- This is a polygon layer of census tracts that cover land areas. Tracts are statistical areas designed by the US Census Bureau to have an ideal size of 4,000 residents, with a range of 1,200 to 8,000. This layer was created from the Census TIGER/Line shapefiles, published in 2021 and delineated for the 2020 census. The TIGER file was modified to remove large areas of coastal water, so the polygons represent land areas that are appropriate for thematic mapping. A subset of the Census TIGER/Line water features that consisted of the largest and most significant coastal water bodies was used as the clip layer. There are two unique identifiers, a short GEOID with ANSI / FIPS codes, and a long GEOID that includes summary level and geographic component codes plus ANSI FIPS codes. The features can be joined to tabular census data using these codes. This layer was created by the Brown University Library as part of the Ocean State Spatial Database (OSSDB) project, a resource designed for basic geographic analysis and thematic mapping within the State of Rhode Island.

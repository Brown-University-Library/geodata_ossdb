# TITLE
dct_title_s: Coastal Water, Rhode Island, 2021

# DESCRIPTION
dct_description_sm:
- This is a polygon layer of coastal waters surrounding Rhode Island. This layer was created from the Census TIGER/Line shapefiles water features, published in 2021 and delineated for the 2020 census. Water features for counties in and adjacent to Rhode Island were aggregated, and major features that represented coastal water were identified, extracted, and merged into a single feature. This layer was created by the Brown University Library as part of the Ocean State Spatial Database (OSSDB) project, a resource designed for basic geographic analysis and thematic mapping within the State of Rhode Island. This particular layer was used to clip the census boundary layers in the database, to create land-based areas for thematic mapping.

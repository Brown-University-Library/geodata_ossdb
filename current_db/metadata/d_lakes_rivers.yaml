# TITLE
dct_title_s: Lakes and Rivers, Rhode Island, 2021

# DESCRIPTION
dct_description_sm:
- This is a polygon layer of major lakes and rivers in Rhode Island. This layer was created from the Census TIGER/Line shapefiles water features, published in 2021 and delineated for the 2020 census. Water features for counties in and adjacent to Rhode Island were aggregated, and features that represented the largest lakes and were identified and extracted. The layer is intended for basic reference mapping. The unique identifier is hyrdroid, created by the Census Bureau. This layer was created by the Brown University Library as part of the Ocean State Spatial Database (OSSDB) project, a resource designed for basic geographic analysis and thematic mapping within the State of Rhode Island.

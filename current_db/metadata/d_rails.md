# TITLE
dct_title_s: Passenger Railroad Routes, Rhode Island, 2021

# DESCRIPTION
dct_description_sm:
- This is a line layer of passenger railroad tracks in Rhode Island, representing Amtrak's Northeast Corridor Line. Portions of the route are also served by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA). This layer was created from the Census TIGER/Line shapefiles railroad features, published in 2021 and delineated for the 2020 census. Rail features for all counties in Rhode Island were aggregated, and the portions of track that represent the Northeast Corridor were identified and extracted. Freight lines, most spurs, and discontinuous tracks were omitted. The geometry of the remaining features was modified to fill gaps and remove overlaps in the line work, using the OpenStreetMap as a reference. The final layer serves as a general representation of the route and the location of tracks, for reference mapping purposes. The unique identifier is linearid, created by the Census Bureau. This layer was created by the Brown University Library as part of the Ocean State Spatial Database (OSSDB) project, a resource designed for basic geographic analysis and thematic mapping within the State of Rhode Island.

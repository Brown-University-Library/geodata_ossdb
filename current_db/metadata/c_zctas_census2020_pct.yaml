# TITLE
dct_title_s: 2020 Census Percent Totals for ZCTAs, Rhode Island, 2020

# DESCRIPTION
dct_description_sm:
- This is a census data table of population statistics for ZIP Code Tabulation Areas in Rhode Island. ZCTAs are statistical areas designed by the US Census Bureau to approximate delivery areas for USPS ZIP Codes. The data in this table is from the 2020 Census Demographic Profile table DP1 and includes all percent totals by age, sex, race, ethnicity, and family relationships, as well as housing unit percentages that were published in that table (actual counts are stored in a separate table). Variable IDs are correlated with labels in a separate census2020_lookup table. There are two unique identifiers, a short GEOID with ANSI / FIPS codes, and a long GEOID that includes summary level and geographic component codes plus ANSI FIPS codes. The records can be joined to spatial features using these codes. A Python script was written to extract the data from the Census Bureau's API and process it for inclusion in the database. This table was created by the Brown University Library as part of the Ocean State Spatial Database (OSSDB) project, a resource designed for basic geographic analysis and thematic mapping within the State of Rhode Island.

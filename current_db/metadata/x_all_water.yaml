# TITLE
dct_title_s: Bodies of Water, Rhode Island, 2021

# DESCRIPTION
dct_description_sm:
- This is a polygon layer of all inland and coastal water within the boundaries of Rhode Island and in adjacent counties in neighboring states. This layer was created from the Census TIGER/Line shapefiles water features, published in 2021 and delineated for the 2020 census. Water features for counties in and adjacent to Rhode Island were aggregated, and major features that represented coastal water and major rivers and lakes were selected and identified with a categorical attribute. This layer was created by the Brown University Library as part of the Ocean State Spatial Database (OSSDB) project, a resource designed for basic geographic analysis and thematic mapping within the State of Rhode Island. This layer served as the basis for creating both the coastal water and the major rivers and lakes features. It is included in the database for users who wish to create their own water body extracts, to illustrate additional detail. The unique identifier is hydroid, created by the Census Bureau.

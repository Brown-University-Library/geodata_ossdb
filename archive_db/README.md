# OSSDB Archives

## Introduction

This directory contains previous versions of Ocean State Spatial Database (OSSDB); visit the main page for the [latest version](https://github.com/Brown-University-Library/geodata_ossdb). New versions of the database are published each year, where specific spatial layers and tables are dropped and replaced with new data. The older versions are provided here for users that wish to retrieve older data. Copies of the older codebooks and metadata are included, so you can identify what has changed. The codebook for each database version includes a description of what was updated, and a table that lists the data sources. The z_metadata table in each database also lists sources and years.
